Assignment
----------

Write a final reflection paper (2 to 5 pages). You can choose any form for that paper. Here are a few things that you may want to include:

1.  Your key insights on the topic.
2.  Your key insights on your self.
3.  What touched you and why?
4.  What do you want to create going forward: the life and leadership intention that crystallized for you over the past couple of weeks? What was clarified? What is essential for you?
5.  What questions are you sitting with now?
6.  What support structure are you going to create for yourself (your self) in order to continue your journey (practice; deep listening; coaching; "do what you love, love what you do")?
