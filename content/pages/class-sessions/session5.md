Assignment
----------

1.  Crystallize and clarify your vision and intention going forward. 
  
3.  Define, develop, and create a mini-prototype this week that allows you to explore the future by doing (and by learning from the feedback). A prototype is not just the development of an idea. It's also the testing of that idea with real-life stakeholders and in real-life contexts.
  
5.  Prepare a reflection statement for Session 6 that reports and reflects on your main takeaways from this class.
