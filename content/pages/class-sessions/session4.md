Stepping Into the Field of the Future

Assignment
----------

1.  Review your responses to all 15 questions found in the document below. What was the most surprising? What is the essence of what's emerging for you from the Field of the Future exercise?
    
    U Journaling Practice: A 15 Step Journey Through Your Field of the Future ({{% resource_link ce90d9df-3cfc-98bf-43ae-ba1b4bd147eb "PDF" %}})
    
2.  Create a daily reflection practice (maybe in the early morning?) that allows you to connect to the essence of what has emerged for you throughout this class: Who are you? What difference do you want to create going forward? Where do you feel your journey is heading? Simply create a quiet moment every day in which you reconnect to the inner place that you left class with last night. During this time (10-30 mins.) allow yourself to connect to what is most essential for YOU.
3.  Create at least two conversational situations in which you share with each other your views on the 5 questions, particularly the fifth question (What is it that you want to do now?). The main focus this week is on the fifth question: What change do you want to bring into the world? Explore that question by talking about your experience with the Journaling/Field of the Future practice we did last night: What frustrates you the most? What did you see from the helicopter view? What footprint do you want to leave behind? What have you experienced when you crossed the Gate? What advice did you pass on from Self-to-self? What vision and intention do you have for the next 5 years? What do you need to let go of? Etc.
    
    All of this will lead you to the most important question: What mini-prototype project do you want to create that will allow you to explore your future intention by doing?
    
    Summing up: Have at least two conversations: one with your partner/friend, the other with 2 to 5 fellow classmates. Make arrangements for the second conversation today. Your group can be any size, but the bigger the group, the longer the process will take. Have a generative conversation. Enjoy the process—go with the energy and go with the flow!
    
4.  Continue your listening reviews in the evening. Notice that every personal encounter you have throughout the day can lend itself to a mini-empathy practice. Notice also that you can direct your listening in two directions simultaneously: listening to the other, and listening to your inner knowing and feelings. Think about this dual attention.
